# 100 Lives Challenge

A challenge based off EricVanWilderman's 100 Life Recent Tab Challenge. You start with 100 lives, and have to see how many levels in the recent tab you can complete in order within those 100 lives. You may use 3 skips and 3 practice runs. Getting a coin will give you a life back, and getting 3 coins in a level allows you to get back 1 skip or 1 practice run. You may also use 10 lives as a sacrifice for a skip.
